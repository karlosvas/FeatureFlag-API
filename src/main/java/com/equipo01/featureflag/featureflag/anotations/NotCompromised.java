/**
 * Custom validation annotation that ensures a password has not been compromised in known data breaches.
 * This annotation validates that the provided password is not present in databases of compromised passwords,
 * helping to enforce stronger security practices by preventing users from using passwords that have been
 * exposed in security breaches.
 * 
 * <p>The validation is performed by the {@link CompromisedPasswordValidator} class, which implements
 * the actual logic for checking against compromised password databases or services.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This annotation can be applied to any field that represents a password to ensure it meets
 * security standards for password compromise detection.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public class UserRegistrationDTO {
 *     {@code @NotCompromised}
 *     {@code @NotBlank}
 *     private String password;
 *     
 *     getters and setters
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>When validation fails, the default error message "The provided password is compromised and cannot be used."
 * will be returned, though this can be customized by providing a custom message.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Custom message example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code @NotCompromised(message = "Please choose a different password that hasn't been compromised")}
 * private String password;
 * </pre>
 *
