/**
 * Global configuration interface for MapStruct mappers in the Feature Flag application.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines common configuration settings that are shared across all MapStruct
 * mappers in the application. It centralizes mapper behavior to ensure consistency and reduce
 * configuration duplication throughout the codebase.
 *
 * <p>Configuration includes: - Spring component model integration for dependency injection -
 * Unmapped target policy to handle missing field mappings gracefully
 *
 * <p>All mappers that use this configuration will automatically: - Be registered as Spring beans
 * for dependency injection - Ignore unmapped target fields without throwing compilation errors -
 * Follow consistent mapping behavior across the application
 *
 * <p>Annotations used: - {@link MapperConfig} MapStruct annotation indicating that this interface
 * is a mapper configuration. - {@link ReportingPolicy} Enum defining policies for handling unmapped
 * fields.
