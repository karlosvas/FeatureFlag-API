/**
 * Data Transfer Object for user authentication requests.
 *
 * <p>This DTO represents the credentials required for user authentication in the feature flag
 * management system. It encapsulates the username and password combination that users provide to
 * gain access to the application and obtain authentication tokens for subsequent API operations.
 *
 * <p>The DTO is specifically designed for stateless authentication flows where users provide
 * credentials to receive JWT tokens or similar authentication artifacts. It includes comprehensive
 * validation to ensure credential integrity and prevent authentication attempts with malformed
 * data.
 *
 * <p>Security considerations: - Password validation ensures minimum security requirements -
 * Username validation prevents injection attacks - Field size limits prevent buffer overflow
 * scenarios - No password storage or exposure in logs or responses
 *
 * <p>Authentication flow: 1. Client submits credentials using this DTO 2. Server validates
 * credentials against user database 3. Server returns authentication token upon successful
 * validation 4. Client uses token for subsequent authenticated API calls
 *
 * <p>Key characteristics: - Strict validation for security compliance - Size constraints for system
 * stability - Swagger/OpenAPI integration for documentation - Builder pattern for convenient object
 * construction
 *
 * <p>JSON structure example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "username": "usuario01",
 *   "password": "securePassword123"
 * }
 * </pre>
