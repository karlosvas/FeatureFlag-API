/**
 * Data Transfer Object for user registration requests.
 *
 * <p>This DTO represents the data required to create a new user account in the feature flag
 * management system. It encapsulates the essential information needed for user registration
 * including credentials, contact information, and initial account settings.
 *
 * <p>The DTO is specifically designed for new user registration flows where administrators or users
 * themselves provide the necessary information to establish a new account. It includes
 * comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity and security compliance throughout the
 * registration process.
 *
 * <p>Security features: - Password compromise validation using security databases - Email format
 * validation for communication reliability - Username validation for system consistency - Input
 * sanitization through size constraints
 *
 * <p>Registration flow: 1. Client submits registration data using this DTO 2. Server validates all
 * fields including password security 3. Server creates new user account with default permissions 4.
 * Server returns confirmation or authentication token
 *
 * <p>Default user settings: - Role: USER (standard permissions) - Status: Active (enabled for
 * immediate use) - Permissions: Basic feature flag access
 *
 * <p>Key characteristics: - Comprehensive validation for security and data integrity - Email
 * validation for communication purposes - Password security validation against known compromises -
 * Swagger/OpenAPI integration for API documentation - Builder pattern support for flexible object
 * construction
 *
 * <p>JSON structure example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "username": "usuario01",
 *   "email": "usuario01@email.com",
 *   "password": "securePassword123"
 * }
 * </pre>

   * hashed and salted before storage - Never stored in plain text within the system
   *
   * <p>The password can be changed after account creation through secure password reset mechanisms
   * that require proper identity verification.
