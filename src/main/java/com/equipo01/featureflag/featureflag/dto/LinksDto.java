/**
 * Data Transfer Object for pagination links in API responses.
 *
 * <p>This DTO represents the links section of paginated API responses, providing navigation URLs
 * for clients to traverse through large datasets. It follows RESTful API pagination standards and
 * provides a structured way to include navigation metadata in JSON responses.
 *
 * <p>The links object typically accompanies paginated data to help clients: - Navigate to the first
 * page of results - Navigate to the last page of results - Navigate to the next page of results -
 * Navigate to the previous page of results - Understand the total count of available items
 *
 * <p>This implementation supports common pagination patterns such as: - Offset-based pagination -
 * Cursor-based pagination - Page number-based pagination
 *
 * <p>JSON structure example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "count": "150",
 *   "first": { "href": "/api/features?page=1" },
 *   "last": { "href": "/api/features?page=15" },
 *   "next": { "href": "/api/features?page=3" },
 *   "prev": { "href": "/api/features?page=1" }
 * }
 * </pre>
