/**
 * Data Transfer Object for transporting error information in API responses.
 *
 * <p>This DTO is designed to provide structured error information to API clients, encapsulating
 * exception details in a standardized format that maintains consistency across the application. It
 * serves as the primary mechanism for error communication between different layers of the
 * application without exposing internal implementation details or sensitive system information.
 *
 * <p>The ErrorDto follows RFC 7807 (Problem Details for HTTP APIs) principles by providing
 * structured error information that includes both human-readable descriptions and machine-readable
 * status codes. This enables clients to handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful feedback
 * to end users.
 *
 * <p>Key features: - Structured error information with multiple detail levels - HTTP status code
 * integration for REST API compatibility - Timestamp tracking for error occurrence and debugging -
 * Swagger/OpenAPI documentation support for API documentation - Builder pattern support for
 * flexible object construction
 *
 * <p>Common usage scenarios: - Validation errors with detailed field-specific messages - Business
 * logic violations with contextual information - Authentication and authorization failures -
 * Resource not found errors with helpful suggestions - Internal server errors with correlation IDs
 * for debugging
 *
 * <p>JSON structure example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "message": "Validation Failed",
 *   "description": "The request contains invalid data in multiple fields",
 *   "code": 400,
 *   "timestamp": "2025-09-16 14:30:45"
 * }
 * </pre>
