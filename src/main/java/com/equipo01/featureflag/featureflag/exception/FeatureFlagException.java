/**
 * Custom runtime exception for feature flag related business logic violations and errors.
 *
 * <p>This exception serves as the primary exception type for all feature flag operations within the
 * application. It provides comprehensive error information including HTTP status codes, detailed
 * messages, and descriptive explanations to support proper error handling and client communication.
 *
 * <p>The exception is designed to work seamlessly with REST API error handling mechanisms,
 * providing structured error information that can be easily transformed into appropriate HTTP
 * responses. It extends RuntimeException to provide unchecked exception behavior, allowing it to be
 * thrown without explicit declaration while maintaining meaningful error context.
 *
 * <p>Key features: - HTTP status code integration for REST API compatibility - Structured error
 * messaging with multiple detail levels - Support for various feature flag operation failures -
 * Lombok integration for automatic getter generation
 *
 * <p>Common usage scenarios: - Feature not found errors (404 Not Found) - Feature configuration
 * conflicts (409 Conflict) - Invalid feature operations (400 Bad Request) - Internal feature
 * processing errors (500 Internal Server Error)
